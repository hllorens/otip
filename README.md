Description
-----------

TIPSem is a temporal information extraction software written in Java.
It automatically annotates from raw text TimeML (http://timeml.org) temporal 
expressions, events, and temporal relations (tlink).
TIPSem is a command line application.


Requirements:
------------
- UNIX/Linux/MacOS              Issues in Win/Cygwin (~~WINDOWS, CYGWIN~~ NOT SUPPORTED)
- UNIX-like shell 		(Linux, Mac OS)
				(Windows DOS does not work)
				(Cygwin still not ready to work some paths need to be adapted in the code)
				
- JRE 6 or later		(http://www.java.com/)
- Maven                         (http://maven.apache.org/) 
   [last tested 3.3.9]		just download untar and add bin/ to the path
- gcc/g++                       (http://openwall.info/wiki/internal/gcc-local-build) 
   [last tested 4.6.3]          to compile CRF++ , newer CRF++ can work with newer g++
- CRF++ 0.53 (or later)*	(https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/) 
   [recommended/tested 0.58]	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local && make && make install, add bin/ to the path
				Test it: crf_test --version (from any path)
- Treetagger            	The new version does not work, use 
				www.cognitionis.com/TreeTagger.tar.gz or https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pdlhg4rwv6smos/TreeTagger.tar.gz?dl=0, that is a copy [the original treetagger license applies])


* For compiling CRF++ if 0.58 you can use g++ >=4.6 < 0.55, g++ compiler must be <= 4.5.
(e.g., UBUNTU -- two versions of g++ can coexist: sudo apt-get install g++-4.4 
	--> ./configure CXX=g++-4.4 --prefix $HOME/local && make && make install)


Optional: Only if you are an expert on installing libraries -------------------
- TinySVM 0.09 (for SVM)	(http://chasen.org/~taku/software/TinySVM/)
- YamCha 0.33 (for SVM)*	(http://chasen.org/~taku/software/yamcha/)
- Freeling2.1 or greater (only for Spanish)(http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/)(read license)
  - Tested successfully up to version 4.0 (June-2019)
    - IMPORTANT: We don't provide CRF models for tlinks in es-es so use SVM for that. See known-issues and solution.

* For compiling Yamcha downgrade compiler to 4.1 (./configure CXX=g++-4.1).
	You need to install g++-4.1.
	(e.g., UBUNTU LTS versions: sudo apt-get install g++-4.1)


IMPORTANT NOTE:
	- If you never installed a library in Linux you probably need to export 
		the library path: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
	- And if you do not want to do it every time you probably want to add 
		it in the files:
			.bashrc	.bash_profile

Installation
------------
1) Install the requirements (JRE7, Maven and CRF++). On windows you can just download zip, extract to C: and add to the PATH

2) Extract TIPSem folder in any_location of your computer

3) Run: "mvn clean package" to obtain the "target/" distribution, 
	copy it in the desired location (e.g., path_to_TIPSem-x.x.x)
	
4) Install TreeTagger as follows:
	- cd path_to_TIPSem-x.x.x/program-data/ (the compiled "target/" one)
	- If TreeTagger/tree-tagger-english bin/ cmd/ are not there -> 
	wget http://www.cognitionis.com/TreeTagger.tar.gz or https://www.dropbox.com/s/4pdlhg4rwv6smos/TreeTagger.tar.gz?dl=0
	- tar xfzf TreeTagger.tar.gz
	- make sure that every file is executable in /bin and /cmd, make sure 
	  that "TreeTagger/tree-tagger-english" have execution permissions
	- chmod a+x program-data/TreeTagger/tree-tagger-english 
          program-data/TreeTagger/bin/* program-data/TreeTagger/cmd/*
	  NOTE: if you do not want to use that path intall TreeTagger 
                in any path and tune program-data/config.properties file
		By default renamed to example.config.properties
	Test it: echo "I went to cinema yesterday." | path-to-otip/program-data/TreeTagger/tree-tagger-english
		WINDOWS/CIGWIN: Download Windows version of TreeTagger https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/#Windows
		perl cmd/utf8-tokenize.perl -e -a lib/english-abbreviations FILE-TO-ANNOTATE | ./bin/tree-tagger lib/english.par -token -lemma -sgml -no-unknown

Modification to make TreeTagger work alone in tree-tagger-english script (with relative paths):
```
#!/bin/bash

# Hector Llorens hack for executing TreeTagger

scriptPath=$(cd $(dirname $0); pwd -P)

pushd . > /dev/null;

cd $scriptPath;

BIN=./bin
CMD=cmd
LIB=lib

OPTIONS="-token -lemma -pt-with-lemma -no-unknown"

TOKENIZER=${CMD}/tokenize.pl
TAGGER=${BIN}/tree-tagger
ABBR_LIST=${LIB}/english-abbreviations
PARFILE=${LIB}/english.par
LEXFILE=${LIB}/english-lexicon.txt

#$TOKENIZER -e -a $ABBR_LIST $* |
# remove empty lines
#grep -v '^$' |
# external lexicon lookup
#perl $CMD/lookup.perl $LEXFILE |
# tagging
#$TAGGER $OPTIONS $PARFILE | 
#perl -pe 's/\tV[BDHV]/\tVB/;s/IN\/that/\tIN/;'
##TOKENIZER=${CMD}/utf8-tokenize.perl

perl cmd/utf8-tokenize.perl -e -a lib/english-abbreviations $* | ./bin/tree-tagger lib/english.par -token -lemma -sgml -no-unknown
#perl ${CMD}/utf8-tokenize.perl -e -a $ABBR_LIST $* | ${BIN}/tree-tagger $ABBR_LIST -token -lemma -sgml -no-unknown | 
#perl -pe 's/\tV[BDHV]/\tVB/;s/IN\/that/\tIN/;'

popd;
```
	CIGWIN issue: TIPSem might be trying bad paths i.e., non windows compatible or too compatible? java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/bin/sh": CreateProcess error=2, The system cannot find the file specified. Tree Tagger works standalone with the script above but not when called from TIPSem in cygwin. 
	SOLUTION: cygpath -w should be added in many places, currently the program is trying file:// which is not working on cygwin



5) Obtain models:

- Option A (easy): Copying the models from http://cognitionis.com/TIPSem.zip or https://www.dropbox.com/s/wf6pfw3ud9jclag/TIPSem.zip?dl=0. They are located in the folders "program-data/CRF++" and "program-data/SVM".
    -- copy the "models/" folder into your "target/program-data/CRF++/models/"

- Option B (difficult): Training your own models using a TimeML annotated corpus e.g., TimeBank or the TempEval-3 trainset (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9586532).
This should provide a good insight on the actions available including training+test over a dataset:
https://github.com/hllorens/otip/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cognitionis/tipsem/OptionHandler.java
Running the help option (see below) will also provide useful info.

6) OPTIONAL (only needed for es-ES): See es.cfg file of Freeling

 # DictionaryFile=$FREELINGSHARE/es/maco.db # uncomment this line

 DictionaryFile=$FREELINGSHARE/es/mydicc.db # comment this line

But mydicc.db does not exist.

Everything works fine after swapping the comment:
 DictionaryFile=$FREELINGSHARE/es/maco.db
 # DictionaryFile=$FREELINGSHARE/es/mydicc.db

permissions are important



Usage
-----

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have models (installation step 5)

Run TIPSem help:  java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar" -h

TIPSem input must be UTF8 (or ASCII). Run with -h to get the following help:

 -a,--action <arg>             	Action/s (annotatecrf, annotate)
 
 -ap,--action_parameters <arg> 	Actions can have comma separated params
				Valid parameters are:
				dct (default: today date)
                                entities (default: timex, event, tlink) [separated by ; e.g., timex;event]
                                inputf (default: plain) options: plain, te3input, tml, isotml
                                
-d,--debug                      Debug mode: Output stack trace (default: off) 

 -h,--help                      Print this help 
 

 -l,--lang <arg>                Language code (en,es) (default  auto-detect) 
 
 -t,--text <arg>                To use text instead of a file (for short texts) 



Examples:
--------

Annotate text: java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar" -t "I saw you yesterday"

Annotate file: java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar" file.txt

Annotate folder: java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar" folder/*.txt

Change dct and annotate only events: java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar"
       -a annotatecrf -ap dct=1999-09-01,entities=event -t "I saw you yesterday"

Change annotate timex and events but not tlinks: java -jar "path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar"
       -a annotatecrf -ap entities=timex;event -t "I saw you yesterday"
       
Force language English and use SVM (normal TIPSemB): java -jar 
"path_to_jar/tipsem-1.0.0.jar" -a annotate -t "I saw you yesterday" -l en
For Spanish: -l es

* for -t input the output is written in the standard output.

* for file/s input the output is written is a file with the same name + ".tml"

Known issues:
------------
https://github.com/hllorens/otip/issues/2 There are no crf models for es-es tlink e-dct and e-t (tlink)
Errors found (CRF++):
        java.lang.Exception: Template file (TIPSemB_categ_e-t_ES.CRFmodel) not found.
        java.lang.Exception: Template file (TIPSemB_categ_e-dct_ES.CRFmodel) not found.
Solution use the SVM version in general for es-es with `-a annotate`.
If you need to annotate timex and events with CRF and only links with SVM then make use of `-ap entities=tlink -inputf tml` using the timex and event annotated part which you can obtain before with `-ap entities=timex;event -inputf plain`.
