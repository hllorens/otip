<s>On the other hand, it's <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">turning</EVENT> out to be another very bad financial week for Asia.</s>
<s>The financial assistance from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">helping</EVENT>.</s>
<s>In the last twenty four hours, the value of the Indonesian stock market has <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">fallen</EVENT> by twelve percent.</s>
<s>The Indonesian currency has <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">lost</EVENT> twenty six percent of its value.</s>
<s>In Singapore, stocks <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">hit</EVENT> a five year low.</s>
<s>In the Philippines, a four year low.</s>
<s>And in Hong Kong, a three percent drop.</s>
<s>More problems in Hong Kong for a place, for an economy, that many experts <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">thought</EVENT> was once invincible.</s>
<s>Here's ABC's Jim Laurie.</s>
<s>Not that long ago, before the Chinese takeover, the news about real estate here was that the sky was the limit the highest prices in the world.</s>
<s>So when Wong Kwan <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">spent</EVENT> seventy million dollars for this house, he <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">thought</EVENT> it was a great deal.</s>
<s>He <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">sold</EVENT> the property to five buyers and <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">said</EVENT> he'd <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">double</EVENT> his money.</s>
<s>In Hong Kong, is always <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">belongs</EVENT> to the seller's market.</s>
<s>Now with new construction under way, three of his buyers have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">backed</EVENT> out.</s>
<s>And Wong Kwan will be lucky to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">break</EVENT> even.</s>
<s>All across Hong Kong, the property market has <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">crashed</EVENT>.</s>
<s>Pamela Pak <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">owns</EVENT> eight condominiums here.</s>
<s>Pak ca n't <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">find</EVENT> buyers.</s>
<s>She <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">estimates</EVENT> her properties, worth a hundred thirty million dollars in October, are worth only half that now.</s>
<s>They <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">believe</EVENT> ah it will be always up <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> up and up ah forever.</s>
<s>Nobody <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">believe</EVENT> this any more.</s>
<s>Of all of Asia's economies, Hong Kong is the most robust.</s>
<s>But in the past three months, stocks have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">plunged</EVENT>, interest rates have <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">soared</EVENT> and the downturn all across Asia <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">means</EVENT> that people are not <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">spending</EVENT> here.</s>
<s>Hotels are only thirty percent full.</s>
<s>You can <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> seventy percent discounts at the shopping malls.</s>
<s>Three thousand dollar pearls for eight hundred dollars.</s>
<s>A two hundred dollar wool jacket for fifty dollars.</s>
<s>Still, there are few buyers.</s>
<s>And at the big brokerage houses, after ten years of boom, they're <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">talking</EVENT> about layoffs.</s>
<s>I <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">think</EVENT> that the mood is fairly gloomy, and I <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">think</EVENT> it's not <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">going</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">change</EVENT> for a couple of years.</s>
<s>So for Hong Kong, it's time, as investment bankers <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">like</EVENT> to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">say</EVENT>, to <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">reposition</EVENT>.</s>
<s>To either <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">hold</EVENT> on tight or <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">get</EVENT> out, as much of Asia <EVENT class="OCCURRENCE">goes</EVENT> into recession.</s>
